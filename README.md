## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Next.js with TypeScript**: Utilized for creating dynamic, responsive UI components. TypeScript enhances code reliability and maintainability.

### Backend
- **Express.js with TypeScript**: Powers the RESTful API, handling data processing and server-side logic. TypeScript is used for better type safety and code structure.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: Chosen for its flexibility and scalability, MongoDB is used for storing and managing user data, as well as application data. Supports CRUD operations essential for the application's functionality.

### Additional Tools and APIs
- **Twitch API**: Integrated for fetching and displaying data from Twitch, essential for the app's core functionality related to streaming analytics.
- **Custom Notifications & Alerts API** (Stretch Goal): A planned feature to develop a custom API for real-time notifications and alerts, enhancing user engagement.
- **Charts API for Data Visualization** (Stretch Goal): To be integrated for visually representing data, making analytics more user-friendly and insightful.
